	abstract = {In this paper, A-not-A questions are analyzed in a post-syntactic approach.
The operation that forms the A-not-A questions consists of two M-merger
stages. First, Lowering is carried out to attach the A-not-A operator to the
target. Afterward, Local Dislocation applies to pick up the candidate for
reduplication. M-merger of the A-not-A operator to its target is a
movement of Morphosyntactic Word to another Morphosyntactic Word.
Since movement of a Morphosyntactic Word to Subword is prohibited for
the A-not-A operation, adjoined modifiers cannot feed the A-not-A
formation. On the other hand, the A-not-A operator can only pick its
adjacent MWd as the candidate for reduplication, because linear order
should be obeyed. Based on different reduplication domains, various
subtypes of A-not-A questions, such as A-not-AB and AB-not-A, can be
derived. To summarize this study, the A-not-A constructions are analyzed
in a unified fashion.},

	abstract = {By examining Cantonese A-not-A questions containing quantificational elements and on
the assumption of the Minimalist framework (Chomsky 1995), I propose that an A-not-A
question is formed by the movement of the question operator base-generated in sentential
Neg 0 head to [Spec,CP] to check the question feature in the head C 0 . (Cf. Cheng 1991,
Chomsky 1995) A reduplication of the verb or modal auxiliary immediately dominated by
NegP is triggered and inserted before the negative morpheme before Spell-Out. Adopting
this configuration, the ill-formedness of A-not-A questions containing elements of
quantification in certain structural positions can be explained by the violation of
Relativized Minimality (Rizzi 1990).},

It shows that the lack of syntactic interaction between temporal and locative adverbs on the one hand and the A-not A operator on the other follows directly from their being related to the world and time coordinates of the formal interpretation.},

including VP-neg questions. It is proposed that all A-not-A subtypes are derived
from a simplex VP source via morphological reduplication, with certain subtypes
undergoing a further process of anaphoric ellipsis. Under this proposal, VP-neg
questions are formed by deleting the second VP of a reduplicated VP-not-VP
structure. It is argued that the analysis of VP-neg as an A-not-A variant is more
desirable than the analysis of VP-neg as being on a par with a particle question
(Cheng et al. 1996), because a number of parallelisms are shown to exist between
VP-neg and other subtypes of A-not-A questions, but not between VP-neg and
typical particle questions.},

@article{Ernst1995,
	abstract = {This paper proposes an analysis of Mandaiin Chinese negation in which bu 'not' is an adverb in Spec,AuxP or Spec,VP which may occur only with unbounded aspeetual situations and which must cliticize to the following element at S-structure. Evidence comes primarily from the facts that (i) bu does not normally occur with perfective aspect markers or with telic situations (such as achievements), and (2) while bu occurs with preverbal adjuncts, it cannot cooccur with certain types of postverbal adjuncts: it is argued that postposing the latter from their base preverbal position leaves a trace which prevents bu from clitieizing, as it must. Evidence comes also from (3) the untenability of alternative analyses invoking scope or overt head movement. This analysis supports the views that morphological requirements of functional items may have important consequences for syntax and that the distribution of such items can be accounted for, in part, by 'Affix Checking', i.e., head movement at LF rather than in overt syntax. },

comparative purposes, Chinese A-not-A questions and English alternative
questions are also discussed. It is concluded that only Chinese alternative

absence of island effects.},

@article{Hsieh2004,
	abstract = {This paper focuses on the non-interrogative existential interpretation of an A-not-A form. Such an A-not-A form in Chinese is argued to occur in the complement of a polarity determiner that needs to be licensed in an appropriate context. This explains why an existential A-not-A form cannot be licensed in the same clause with a licenser. Evidence supporting this analysis comes from island effects, the selection of verbs, the use of connectors, the use of daodi ‘indeed’ and, finally, the use of shenme ‘what’ as a determiner. This analysis, in turn, supports the Determiner Phrase (DP) Hypothesis proposed by Abney (1987) and the DP analysis proposed for Chinese (Tang 1990, Li 1998, among others).},

argue that Huang is incorrect in assimilating the "disjunctive" variety of A-not-A
questions to alternative questions, in that disjunctive questions are subject to a
number of restrictions that do not apply to alternative questions, for example, a
restriction that the positive conjunct precede the negative one. While accepting the
basic idea of Huang's rule for "reduplicative" A-not-A questions, I note that restric-
tions on negation are mirrored not only in disjunctive questions, where for Huang
the negative element is a real negation, but also in reduplicative questions, where for
Huang there is only an apparent negation. I conclude that the full spectrum of
A-not-A questions in Chinese reflects not synchronically unrelated constructions
but rather different ways of specializing an alternative question for the function of a
yes-no question.},
